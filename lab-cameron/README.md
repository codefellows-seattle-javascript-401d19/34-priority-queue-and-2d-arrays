# Priority Queues and 2D Arrays

Data Structure and Algorithm practice.

## Priority Queues

There are two kinds of priority queues here -- one which implements a Heap
to do the organization, and another which uses a for loop, checking for
each elements priority level before enqueuing.

The heap implementation makes for a much more efficient queue but also
needs a lot more code.

## Theater Blockers

This is an algorithm problem to determine who is blocking what number of
members in a theater seated behind some coordinate x-y. It involves first
parsing a string, then traversing a 2-dimensional array along the y-axis
to determine the number of viewers being blocked.
